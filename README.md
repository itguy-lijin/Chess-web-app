# Chess App
This is a chess app that allows users to create an account and play against another player or a computer AI. The user will be able to make games and send an invite code to friends that allows the two players to play together.

## Getting Started
Start by cloning the repository. Make sure that your current version of node is **v16.13.0** and make sure you are in the chess directory. Then run the following command:

``` npm install ```

Do this for the chess-backend directory as well.

To start the local angular server run:

``` npm run start ```

The local server will listen on localhost:4200 by default.

To start the back-end server, make sure you are in the chess-backend directory and run

``` npm start ```

The back-end server will listen on localhost:8001 by default.

## About the Project
